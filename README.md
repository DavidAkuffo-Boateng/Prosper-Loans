# Prosper Loans Exploration
## by (David Akuffo-Boateng)


## Prosper Loans
> Prosper Loans is a Carlifornia-based peer-to-peer lending platform, where individuals can either invest in personal loans or request to borrow money. The dataset consisted of 113,937 loans with 81 variables. I investigated the features that increased the chances of getting a loan. Not all the variables were used in the analysis. Those that were used were: ProsperRating (Alpha), LoanOriginalAmount, DebtToIncomeRatio, IncomeRange, MonthlyLoanPayment, StatedMonthlyIncome, LoanOriginationDate, EmploymentStatus, IsBorrowerHomeowner, IncomeVerifiable, Term and ListingCategory.


## Summary of Findings

> After a thorough analysis of the variables used, these were the findings;

> Borrowers who took large amount of loans generally had a higher Propser Rating

> Most Borrowers who took loans were employed, and most of them had higher Prosper Ratings, with C-rating having the largest number of borrowers.

> Borrowers with high Stated Monthly Income had a higher Prosper Rating

> Loan Original Amount and Monthly Loan Amount had a strong positive correlation; which obviously meant that the higher the loan original amount, the higher the monthly loan payment.

> Debt to Income Ratio is inversely proportional to Prosper Rating; meaning the lower a borrower's debt to income ratio, the higher the prosper rating and chance of getting the loan.

> All borrowers who were working had higher prosper ratings and took larger amounts of loans.

> Borrowers who were employed or worked full-time had larger montly incomes and higher ratings than the other types of employment status.
